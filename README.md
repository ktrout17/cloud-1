###### Introduction to databases, data and cloud servers

## Project Requirements:

Install a simple wordpress site on cloud infrastructure.

   - Website must be running on at least 2 servers (if possible, in different server farms).
   - A Load Balancer to redirect requests to any of the available servers.
   - Traffic spikes will cause new servers to launch, and traffic decreases will cause new servers to shutdown.
   - Logged in users will stay identified for the length of a normal session.
   - New content on the site should be available across all instances as soon as possible.
   - Static content should be distributed via CDN.
   - Failures should be handled so that website uptime is not interrupted.
   - Hosting cost should reflect actual usage.
   - Appropriate firewall rules / protection measures should be in place as to avoid inappropriate access.
